# System Installation and Architecture - Assignments

This document outlines the assignments for the "System Installation and Architecture" module of the course. These assignments are designed to apply practical knowledge and deepen understanding of secure Linux installation, system architecture, and filesystem management.

## Assignment 1: Install Ubuntu on a Virtual Machine

### Objective
Install Ubuntu on a virtual machine using VirtualBox and configure it for secure operation.

### Instructions
1. Download the latest version of Ubuntu Desktop.
2. Install VirtualBox on your computer.
3. Create a new virtual machine and install Ubuntu.
4. Apply best practices for secure installation (use strong passwords, disable root account, configure firewall).
5. Document the installation process and the security measures taken.
6. Submit a report detailing each step, decisions made, and rationale behind security configurations.

## Assignment 2: Disk Encryption Implementation

### Objective
Implement full disk encryption on a Linux installation.

### Instructions
1. Use a virtual machine or a spare computer where data loss is not a concern.
2. Install any popular Linux distribution (e.g., Ubuntu, Fedora).
3. During installation, select the option for full disk encryption.
4. Document the installation process, focusing on the disk encryption steps.
5. Test the system by rebooting and verifying that disk encryption functions as expected.
6. Submit a report on the setup process and any challenges encountered.

## Assignment 3: Explore the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy

### Objective
Deepen understanding of the Linux filesystem hierarchy by exploring various system directories and their purposes.

### Instructions
1. Using a Linux system (physical or virtual), open a terminal.
2. Navigate through key directories (`/bin`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, `/home`, etc.).
3. Identify the types of files found in each directory and document what each directory is used for.
4. Prepare a brief report or presentation that:
   - Describes the purpose of each directory.
   - Discusses the types of files located in each directory and their importance for system operations.
   - Highlights any security considerations related to these directories (e.g., why certain permissions are set by default).
5. Submit your findings and reflect on how this knowledge will impact your approach to Linux system administration.

## Conclusion

These assignments are intended to provide hands-on experience with Linux installation, filesystem exploration, and to foster an understanding of the underlying architecture that supports Linux system operations. Each task focuses on practical skills that are crucial for anyone aspiring to work with Linux professionally.
