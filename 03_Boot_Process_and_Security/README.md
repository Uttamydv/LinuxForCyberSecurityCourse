# Boot Process and Security

Welcome to the "Boot Process and Security" module of the "Linux for Cyber Security Course." This module is crucial for understanding the sequential steps that Linux undergoes from startup to shutdown and integrating security measures at each phase to safeguard the system.

## Module Objectives

- Explain the detailed steps involved in the Linux boot process.
- Identify critical security checkpoints during the boot process.
- Implement security measures such as full disk encryption and secure boot configurations.
- Understand the roles of different boot-related components like the BIOS/UEFI, bootloader, kernel, and init system.
