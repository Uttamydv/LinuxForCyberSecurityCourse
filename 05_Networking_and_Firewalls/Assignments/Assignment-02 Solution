#First check for the iptables command is installed on your vm because in nowdays iptables are replaced by the nftables 
#but available for the compatible purpose So to check iptable are installed
iptables -t
#if not installed then install it by along with the iptables-persistent because the default iptables.service are unavailale
sudo apt-get install iptables iptables-persistent netfilter-persistent
#Also if your vm has nftables or firewalld enable, then it cause the conflict with the iptables so disable them
systemctl status nftables
#If active
systemctl stop nftables
systemctl disable nftables
systemctl status nftables
#similar for firewalld
systemctl status firewalld
if active
systemctl stop firewalld 
systemctl disable firewalld
systemctl status firewalld
#Now define the firewall rules for the filter table for incoming input chain
#Accept the SSH connection from any destination
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
#Accept the Htttp packet from any destination
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
#Drop any other type of packet by setting the default policy to drop 
iptables -P INPUT DROP
#List the iptables rules
iptables -P
#To make these rules persistent after the reboot
netfilter-persistent save
#The rules will be saved to /etc/iptables/rules.v4
