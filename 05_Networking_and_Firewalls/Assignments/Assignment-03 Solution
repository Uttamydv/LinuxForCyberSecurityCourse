#For establishing an ssh connection we have to ensure that Openssh-server is installed on the Server and ssh-client is installed 
#on the host to from which we want an SSH connection
#OpenSSH tool is an open source and free which implement the ssh protocol.
#By default the openssh-client i.e ssh adn openssh-server i.e sshd is preinstalled in the linux server and also on the window 10 and
#above version
#if not install them, For linux machine/server
sudo apt-get install Openssh-client openssh-server
#for windows machine/server
Open settings>apps> manage optional features> add features> openssh client and openssh server. 

# Now check for the ssh service should be in running state on the server
#for linux server/machine
systemctl status ssh
systemctl start ssh
#for windows server/machine (run in windows powershell as an adminstrator)
Get-Service -Name ssh
Start-Service -Name ssh
#Now lets estalise the ssh connection using key pair(More secure)
#step -> 1.For ssh connection we have to generate the Private-Public key-pair at the host machine using command-
ssh-keygen 
#store the keys at default location and without passphrase( It is used to encrypt the keys being generated) set them as empty for now
#Now we have a folder in our home directory -> .ssh ,This folder contain the key pair
#id_rsa. -> private key
#id_rsa.pub -> public key

#Step -> 2.Now copy the public key to the server
#For linux host run this command with your server hostname in place of Username and your server ipaddress
ssh-copy-id username@192.168.11.130
with password
#for windows,run this command with your server hostname in place of Username and your server ipaddress
scp ~/home/User/Username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub server_hostname@192.168.11.130 ~/temp_id_rsa.pub
#then,Estabilise a ssh connection using password
ssh username@192.168.11.130 
password 
#At last,Now append the public key file to .ssh/authrized_keys
cat ~/temp_id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized keys

#Now set the permission to .ssh folder to 700 and 600 to authorized_keys
chmod 700 /.ssh $$ chmod 600 ./.ssh/authorized_keys
#Step -> 3.At last we are ready to go. Estabilise ssh with key pair
ssh username@192.168.11.130
#Now we had to disable the ssh connection using password -> for this at your server goto /etc/ssh and update the sshd_config file
cd /etc/ssh
ls
vi sshd_config
add an entry-> PasswordAuthentication no
#Also ensure that PubkeyAuthentication yes
#Now restart the ssh service
sudo systemctl restart ssh
echo We establised a ssh connection with password authentication disable
