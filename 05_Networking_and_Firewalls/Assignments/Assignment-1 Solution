#Check for the assigned ip by the dhcp server
ifconfig
#Firstly we have to shut down the interface to change its configuration 
sudo ifconfig eth0 down 
#Set up a static ip address to any interface of your vm, and here I am taking the eth0 interface
sudo ip addr add 192.168.11.130/24 dev eth0
#Now set up the default gateway i.e the router address to which we are connected to internet
sudo ip route add default via 192.168.11.2
#At last we have to assigned the DNS Server which can't be done through command line 
#For dns we have to manually enter the dns server in the etc/resolv.conf
sudo sh -c 'echo "nameserver 8.8.8.8 " > etc/resolv.conf
#After static ip assignment enable the interface
sudo ifconfig eth0 up
#Check for the current ip configuation and store it into a file in current directory
ifconfig > network_configuration.txt
#Test the connectivity of the network interface 
ping google.com
# We get the ping respose,ensure thant we are connected to the internet.
