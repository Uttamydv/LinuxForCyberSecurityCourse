# Linux Hardening and Network Security - Assignments

## Assignment 1: Hardening the System

### Objective
Demonstrate your ability to apply basic system hardening techniques to a Linux environment.

### Tasks
1. **Disable Unnecessary Services**: Identify and disable at least three unnecessary services on your system.
2. **Secure SSH**: Implement key-based authentication for SSH and disable password-based authentication. Additionally, disable root login over SSH.
3. **Configure a Basic Firewall**: Using either `ufw` or `iptables`, configure a firewall that allows only SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS traffic while blocking all other incoming connections.
4. **Set Up Automatic Security Updates**: Configure your system to automatically apply security updates.

### Submission
- Provide a script named `system_hardening.sh` that performs all the tasks mentioned above.
- Ensure the script includes comments explaining each step and the rationale behind it.

## Assignment 2: Filesystem and Data Encryption

### Objective
Demonstrate your ability to encrypt partitions, swap space, and backup data securely.

### Tasks
1. **Encrypt a Partition with LUKS**: Create an encrypted partition using LUKS, format it, and mount it securely.
2. **Encrypt Swap Space**: Configure your system to use encrypted swap space.
3. **Encrypt Backup Data**: Create an automated script that compresses and encrypts a backup directory using `gpg`.

### Submission
- Provide a script named `filesystem_encryption.sh` that performs all the tasks mentioned above.
- Ensure the script includes comments explaining each step and the rationale behind it.

## Assignment 3: Network Security Configuration

### Objective
Demonstrate your ability to secure network services and monitor network activity on your Linux system.

### Tasks
1. **Secure SSH Access**: Restrict SSH access to a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses.
2. **Configure TCP Wrappers**: Use TCP Wrappers to allow access to one service from a specific IP address and block all other connections.
3. **Set Up Network Monitoring**: Install `nmap` and `tcpdump`, and use them to scan your local network and capture traffic on a specific interface. Save the output of the scan and capture.
4. **Set Up a VPN**: Install and configure either OpenVPN or WireGuard for secure remote access to your system.

### Submission
- Provide a script named `network_security.sh` that performs all the tasks mentioned above.
- Include the output of your `nmap` scan and `tcpdump` capture as separate files (`nmap_scan.txt` and `tcpdump_capture.txt`).
- Ensure the script includes comments explaining each step and the rationale behind it.

## Assignment 4: Using Security Tools

### Objective
Demonstrate your ability to use security tools like `auditd`, `fail2ban`, and `AIDE` to enhance system security.

### Tasks
1. **Configure `auditd`**: Set up `auditd` to monitor changes to `/etc/passwd` and generate logs whenever modifications are made.
2. **Set Up `fail2ban`**: Configure `fail2ban` to monitor SSH login attempts and block IP addresses that have more than 5 failed login attempts.
3. **Set Up `AIDE`**: Install and configure `AIDE` to monitor file integrity on your system. Run an initial check and generate a report.

### Submission
- Provide a script named `security_tools.sh` that performs all the tasks mentioned above.
- Include the logs generated by `auditd` and the `AIDE` report as separate files (`auditd_log.txt` and `aide_report.txt`).
- Ensure the script includes comments explaining each step and the rationale behind it.

## Submission Guidelines

Submit your scripts via the course's submission platform. Ensure all scripts are executable and well-documented with comments explaining each command. The scripts should be tested to ensure they perform the tasks correctly on the appropriate Linux distribution.
