# Linux Hardening and Network Security

## Module Overview

In this module, you will learn essential Linux hardening strategies and network security configurations. This module focuses on practical security measures to protect Linux systems from various threats, including system hardening techniques, filesystem encryption, and basic network security practices. You will also be introduced to security tools that monitor, detect, and prevent security incidents.

## Lectures

- [Introduction to Linux Security Fundamentals](Lectures/01_Introduction_to_Linux_Security_Fundamentals.md)
  - Learn the basic security concepts and features built into Linux, including user and file permissions, SELinux, and AppArmor.
  
- [System Hardening Strategies](Lectures/02_System_Hardening_Strategies.md)
  - Understand the key strategies for hardening a Linux system, such as disabling unnecessary services, securing SSH, implementing secure password policies, and configuring firewalls.
  
- [Filesystem and Data Encryption](Lectures/03_Filesystem_and_Data_Encryption.md)
  - Learn how to secure your data using encryption techniques, including encrypting partitions, swap space, and backup data.
  
- [Basic Network Security](Lectures/04_Basic_Network_Security.md)
  - Explore essential network security practices, including securing network services, configuring firewalls, and using network monitoring tools.
  
- [Introduction to Security Tools and Best Practices](Lectures/05_Introduction_to_Security_Tools_and_Best_Practices.md)
  - Get an introduction to key security tools like `auditd`, `fail2ban`, `Snort`, and penetration testing tools like `nmap` and Metasploit. Learn best practices for maintaining a secure Linux environment.
  
- [Practical Security Enhancements](Lectures/06_Practical_Security_Enhancements.md)
  - Apply practical security enhancements to secure logs, harden user accounts, improve application security, and implement secure backup and recovery strategies.

## Assignments

- [Linux Hardening and Network Security Assignments](Assignments/Linux_Hardening_and_Network_Security_Assignments.md)
  - Practical tasks to apply your knowledge of Linux hardening and network security, including system hardening, filesystem encryption, network security configurations, and using security tools.

## Resources
